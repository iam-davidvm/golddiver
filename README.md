# Golddiver game

<p>I am currently following a web development course. Because I wanted to do some extra stuff outside this course I decided to make a little game with a touch of Wordle. But without looking at the code of Wordle itself</p>
<p>In this game you have to guess where the treasure is hidden in the water. Everyday the spot of the treasure can change</p>

## What I have learned

This was very fun project to work on and it allowed me to work with several things for the first time:

- LocalStorage

- Animations/keyframes

- Creating a custom radiobutton

- Thinking about a game mechanic


## Things I may change in the future

- Making it a bit more dynamic like adding a sort of animation when you hover over a tile

- Expanding the statistics. I don't think it will be very difficult, but I didn't want to copy Wordle too much

- When the game reveals if you win or lose it's a bit too simple

- Refactor: although it runs smooth, I think there is room to improve the code at every front: html, css and js

- Adding a favicon


## Conclusion

> This is not something I would deliver to a client, but it was a great learning process
